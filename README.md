<!-- • Define Monolithic architecture -->

Monolithic architecture is a software design pattern in which all the application's components and modules are tightly coupled and interconnected. In a monolithic architecture, the entire application is developed as a single, indivisible unit that runs as a single process on a single server or a set of servers.


<!-- Explain microservices in your own understanding -->
Microservices is a software development approach that involves building an application as a set of small, independently deployable services. Each microservice is designed to perform a specific task or function within the application, and communicates with other microservices through well-defined interfaces, such as APIs.


<!-- • Which of the backend architecture appeals to you and why? -->
// microservices architecture //

Scalability: Microservices can be scaled independently, allowing for better resource utilization and cost-effectiveness.

Resilience: If a single service fails, it doesn't affect the entire application, reducing the risk of downtime.

Flexibility: Services can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently, allowing for faster iteration and innovation.

Modularity: Each service can be developed and maintained by a separate team, making it easier to manage and maintain a large application.

Technology diversity: Each service can use a different technology stack, allowing teams to choose the best tool for the job.


<!-- Is Nodejs a multithreaded language? -->
No, Node.js is not a multithreaded language. It uses a single-threaded, event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, which allows it to handle a large number of simultaneous connections with minimal resources.


<!-- What does REPL stand for? -->
REPL stands for Read-Eval-Print Loop. It is a programming environment that allows developers to interact with and test code snippets in real-time.
